        <p>Hello, and welcome to my portfolio. This is my first crack at web development, so I hope I'm off on the
            right foot! A little about myself &mdash; my name is Brian, I'm 31 years old, grew up in a small town in
            central Pennsylvania, and have been living in Philadelphia for the better part of the last 12 years. I have
            two older brothers, a father originally from New York, and a mother originally from Vietnam. I don't have
            any pets right now, but I want a little Shih Tzu someday!
        </p>

        <p>I'm excited to start this journey into the world of coding and web development. I've always had a strong
            interest in computer science, but at the same time, was a bit intimidated by it all. I went to Temple
            University, got a liberal arts degree, got a job, and have been toiling away ever since. I've been very
            fortunate for all of those things, but have been yearning for something more. So I finally put those fears
            to rest, and I'm ready to take on a new challenge in my life! That excitement definitely comes with its
            share of anxiety, but I'm quickly learning that I have a deeper interest and eagerness than I had
            anticipated. I hope that's a good sign!
        </p>

        <p>At the top of this page, you'll find a link to my portfolio, as well as an option to contact me with any
            questions, comments, and feedback! Clicking on my name, or the <strong>About</strong> link, will always
            bring you back to this page right here. At the bottom, you will find my email, and links to my LinkedIn and GitHub pages. I hope you enjoy my first website, and many more to come!</p>
